Pixels:
video quality at 1080p means – the height of video is 1080 pixels.

Now the next question is what is the width of video? There is no exact technically right answer but in common convention, the video is 16:9 for online playback. Thus the width of video becomes 1080*16/9 – 1920 pixels.

E.g a 1080 p will have 1080*1920 = 2073600 pixels.

Bitrate:
the size of a 1hour 1500 kbps video will be – 1500*60*60 -kilobits= 1500*60*60/8000 MBs of data = 675 MB per hour of video data.

There is no precise technical relation between pixels and bitrate.
